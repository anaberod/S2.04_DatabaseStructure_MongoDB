# üçΩÔ∏è MongoDB Restaurant Queries ‚Äì Level 1

## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

This project focuses on learning how to query a NoSQL database using **MongoDB**. The exercise is based on a real-world dataset of restaurants located in New York City. The goal is to run a series of queries on this dataset to retrieve, filter, and manipulate restaurant documents according to various criteria.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** ‚Äì NoSQL document-oriented database
- **MongoDB Compass** ‚Äì GUI for MongoDB queries
- **JSON** ‚Äì Format used for data import/export
- **Markdown** ‚Äì For documentation
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì Version control and hosting

## üìã Requirements

Before running this project, ensure the following are installed on your local machine:

- MongoDB Community Edition ‚Äì version 6.x recommended
- MongoDB Compass ‚Äì latest version
- Git ‚Äì optional, for version control
- A modern browser (for viewing MongoDB Compass UI)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/anaberod/S2.04_DatabaseStructure_MongoDB_Level1.git
   cd S2.04_DatabaseStructure_MongoDB_Level1

2. Start your MongoDB server (if not running automatically):
   mongod

3. Open MongoDB Compass, connect to:
   mongodb://localhost:27017

4. Import the dataset:
   - Open the Restaurants collection in Compass.
   - Click "Add Data" > "Import File".
   - Choose restaurants.json and set file type to "JSON - Each line is a separate document".
   - Click Import.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

Once the data is imported:

1. Go to the Documents tab inside the Restaurants collection.
2. Use the filter bar to execute each query one at a time.
3. You can also use the Options panel to apply:
   - Projections (select specific fields)
   - Sort
   - Limit/Skip results

Example query:
{ "borough": "Bronx" }

## üåê Deployment

This is a local-only educational project, but to deploy to a remote environment:

- Use MongoDB Atlas to host the database in the cloud.
- Import the .json file using the Atlas UI or mongosh.
- Use the same queries via Compass or MongoDB Atlas‚Äôs query console.
